## 🔥 About Me

> *"Building web applications while running a food truck - coding my way into a tech career"*

I'm a chef turned aspiring web developer, actively building my skills in modern web technologies and blockchain development while running a food truck business. Currently seeking opportunities in web development, I'm learning by doing - building projects, experimenting with new tech, and leveraging AI tools to accelerate my learning. My unique background brings creativity, problem-solving skills, and strong work ethic from the culinary world into software development. I'm honest about where I am in my journey: I use GitHub Copilot and AI assistants heavily, I'm still learning best practices, and many of my projects are learning exercises rather than production apps. But I'm committed, consistent, and improving every day.
